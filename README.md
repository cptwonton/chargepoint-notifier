# ‚ö°Ô∏è ChargePoint Notifier

A Python-based, AWS-hosted application that notifies you when a ChargePoint charger becomes available at a specific location.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project uses AWS CDK to deploy a serverless infrastructure that:
- Polls the ChargePoint API every 5 minutes
- Filters for available chargers at a specific location (currently BNA12 stations in Nashville)
- Sends notifications via SNS when chargers become available

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS CDK installed

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cptwonton/chargepoint-notifier.git
cd chargepoint-notifier
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with your AWS account details and configuration preferences.

5. Deploy the stack
```
cdk deploy
```

## üìã Project Structure

- `app.py` - CDK application entry point
- `chargepoint_notifier/` - CDK stack definition
- `lambda/` - Lambda function code
  - `poller.py` - Main Lambda function that polls the ChargePoint API

## üîß Configuration

The application uses the following environment variables:
- `CDK_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` - AWS account ID for deployment
- `CDK_DEPLOY_REGION` - AWS region for deployment
- `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` - ARN of the SNS topic for notifications
- `STATION_NAME_FILTER` - Filter for station names (default: "BNA12")
- `BOUND_BOX_JSON` - Geographic bounding box for the API query

## üìù Future Enhancements

- Add state caching to avoid redundant notifications
- Implement a web UI for configuration
- Support multiple locations
- Add analytics dashboard

## üìö Useful CDK Commands

* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
